To convert directory to repository, go to the directory and perform 'git init' to create a new repository
Create working copy of the local repository by running the command git clone path/to/repository
A repository has 3 trees, namely:
  - Working Directory: holds the actual files
  - Index: acts as the staging area
  - HEAD: points to the last commit made
Adding to the index means proposing changes using command git add <filename> or git add *
To commit the changes git commit -m "Commit message". Now the file is committed to the HEAD but not to the remote repository yet
Changes are in the HEAD of the local repository. To send changes to remote repository, execute git push origin master
