To convert directory to repository, go to the directory and perform 'git init' to create a new repository
Create working copy of the local repository by running the command git clone path/to/repository
A repository has 3 trees, namely:
  - Working Directory: holds the actual files
  - Index: acts as the staging area
  - HEAD: points to the last commit made
Adding to the index means proposing changes using command git add <filename> or git add *
To commit the changes git commit -m "Commit message". Now the file is committed to the HEAD but not to the remote repository yet
Changes are in the HEAD of the local repository. To send changes to remote repository, execute git push origin master

If you have cloned an existing repo and want to connect your repo to a remote server, you need to add it with
git remote add origin <server>
Now you're able to push changes to the selected remote server

branching -

used to develop isolated features
master branch is the default branch when you create a repo.
Use other branches for development and merge them back to the master branch

create a new branch named feature_x and switch to it using 'git checkout -b feature-x'
switch back to master 'git checkout master'
delete the branch again again 'git branch -d feature_x'
push branch to remote repository 'git push origin <branch>'

To update your local repo to the newest commit execute 'git pull' in wd to fetch and merge remote changes
To merge another branch into your active branch (master) use 'git merge <master>'
